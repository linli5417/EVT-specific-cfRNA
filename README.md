# Evaluation of Circulating Cell-Free RNA Derived from EVTs for Early Prediction of Preeclampsia

# 1 Description

Preeclampsia (PE) is a significant maternal condition worldwide, manifesting after 20 weeks of gestation and necessitating early intervention to mitigate extensive health risks to both mothers and their offspring. Cell-free RNA (cfRNA) has emerged as a pivotal noninvasive biomarker for the early detection and monitoring of various diseases, including pregnancy-specific disorders, extending its utility to evaluating therapeutic responses and assessing risks in clinical and research settings. Extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), crucial for placental development and understanding PE, have been studied using cfRNA, offering valuable yet technically constrained insights into their dynamic functions during pregnancy. This study analyzed single-cell sequencing data from the maternal-fetal interface to identify 105 specific cfRNAs derived from EVTs, which exhibited significant variations throughout pregnancy, especially in cases of PE. Focusing on nine cfRNAs that showed significant EVT-specific changes, we were able to predict the early onset of PE accurately. This comprehensive approach underscores EVT-derived cfRNA's potential as a robust, non-invasive biomarker for early preeclampsia detection. Additionally, it offers insights into the early cellular-level pathological shifts within EVT that contribute to the condition's pathogenesis.
